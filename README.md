# sidebar
Sidebar Window, makes the Sidebar undockable (shows as an independend window). And, panels become editable easily by drag and drop. This project was migrated to a new project "Ez Sidebar" ( http://github.com/piroor/ezsidebar ), for Firefox older than its version 57.

This project is obsolete and not maintained anymore.
